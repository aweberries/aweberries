Experienced **Game Developer**
- Unreal Engine
- Programmer, Gameplay & Level & Sound Designer
- I try to be as unique and original as possible. Meaning that I rarely use asset resources from the internet to help me on a project. I would normally only take some gameplay/style inspiration from other games, and texture assets from the internet.

Experienced **3D Artist**
- Blender
- I've been using Blender for quite a while now. I make my own 3D assets in Blender to use for my projects.

Skilled **Graphic Designer**
- Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects
- I have been using Adobe products for approximately 6 years now. I mainly use said products to make graphics for my game.
